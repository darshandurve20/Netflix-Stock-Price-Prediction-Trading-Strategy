# Objective

The project is about analyzing time-series data, forecasting future prices and applying moving average strategy for asset trading & back testing it. In this project - we have designed factor identification modules using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and implemented algorithms like Ordinary Least-Squares Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest & Recurrent Neural Network â€“ LSTM for stock price prediction. Further we have created trading signals to identify the long and short positions and the best time to buy or sell the asset & performed P&L analysis for the portfolio that calculated various aspects like Net Profit, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
